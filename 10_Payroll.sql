To prepare for a payroll, Darnell must provide a list of list of employees that includes their salary 
or hourly pay rate. The list must also include Social Security Numbers and employee IDs so that 
an outside firm can properly process the payroll. Produce an employee list that provides this 
information, and sort it so that itâ€™s easy to find an employee by name. for those employees who 
are on a salary, the list should show their monthly wage. Save this script as 10_Payroll.
